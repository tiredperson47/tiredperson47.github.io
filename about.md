Hello, my name is Ryan Wong and I'm an aspiriing Penetration Tester. I'm currently attending Cal Poly Pomona (CPP).

I became interested in cybersecurity due to the quick development in technology. With the rapid improvement in hardware and software, it's obvious that hackers and malware was going to rapidly increase as well. Because of this I decided, I want to defend myself and other people from such threats by finding the vulnerabilities first. As a result, I decided to become a Penetration Tester.

Some of my hobbies include archery, lock picking, photography, and games. Speaking of which, there is a secret game and art gallery on my website. Can you find it? (Not through github)
